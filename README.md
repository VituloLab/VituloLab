# GUIDELINES

- HOW TO ADD A NEW REPOSITORY
1. Create a new repository using the VituloLab github account. ALWAYS add the README and the gitignore. Licence is not required.
2. Add the contributors to the newly created repository, in order to trace who committed what.
3. In the repository add your templates, files and code.
4. Please edit the README in order to specify file descriptions and location (metadata excels, code templates, which folder contains what etc). In this way, everyone will be able to find what's needed.
